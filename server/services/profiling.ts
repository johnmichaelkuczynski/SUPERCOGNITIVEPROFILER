  const prompt = `You are a SYNTHESIS PROFILER using DIALECTICAL ANALYSIS to examine intellectual-emotional integration patterns.

DIALECTICAL FRAMEWORK MANDATORY: You must provide three complete analyses using the Thesis-Antithesis-Super-Thesis structure.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Analyze intellectual-emotional integration through communication patterns, not stated beliefs. Focus on what the synthesis of reasoning and emotional patterns reveals about how this person's mind actually works.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text.slice(0, 8000)}

DIALECTICAL SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY:

**THESIS (Primary Synthesis Analysis)**: Initial comprehensive assessment of intellectual-emotional integration patterns
**ANTITHESIS (Dissenting Synthesis Analysis)**: Critical counter-interpretation that challenges the primary analysis
**SUPER-THESIS (Refined Synthesis Assessment)**: Final synthesis that addresses the dissenting view and provides the most accurate understanding

FOR EACH DIALECTICAL COMPONENT, analyze these core synthesis elements:
1. INTELLECTUAL-EMOTIONAL INTEGRATION: How cognitive and emotional patterns actually interact
2. DECISION-MAKING SYNTHESIS: Real integration vs. performed balance in decision processes
3. AUTHENTICITY VS. PERFORMANCE: Genuine integration vs. strategic emotional positioning
4. STRESS-CLARITY DYNAMICS: How integration holds under pressure
5. EMPATHY VS. MANIPULATION: Authentic emotional intelligence vs. strategic positioning
6. COGNITIVE-EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE: The actual interface between thinking and feeling systems

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide 2-3 specific quotes for each synthesis component
- Explain how each quote demonstrates the integration pattern
- Show evidence for claims about authentic vs. performed integration

CRITICAL HEURISTICS:
- Over-emphasis on "balance" often indicates imbalance
- Claims of emotional intelligence may mask emotional manipulation
- True synthesis shows natural integration, not forced balance
- Authentic emotional reasoning doesn't need to announce itself

STRUCTURED ANALYSIS INSTRUCTION:

For the given text, you must generate three distinct outputs:

1️⃣ PRIMARY ANALYSIS → Your best cognitive read of the text
2️⃣ DISSENTING ANALYSIS → A plausible, well-argued counter-read that challenges your Primary Analysis
3️⃣ SUPER-THESIS → Critique the Dissenting Analysis, defend your Primary Analysis where correct, concede where appropriate, and produce a sharpened, more accurate final assessment

COGNITIVE PROFILING FRAMEWORK:

You are modeling the author's underlying cognitive process — how they think, not what they say.

You must explicitly assess:

1️⃣ Reasoning depth
Is the author maintaining multiple layers of reasoning?
Are conceptual distinctions being carefully managed across the argument?

2️⃣ Epistemic discipline
Is the author aware of epistemic risk (ambiguity, circularity, misuse of concepts)?
Are they proactively managing that risk in their argument?

3️⃣ Meta-cognitive awareness
Is the author showing awareness of the limitations of their own argument or of the tools of analysis?
Are they demonstrating awareness of how explanation itself can go wrong?

4️⃣ Conceptual targeting precision
Are key terms and distinctions precisely defined and maintained?
Is the author resisting slippage between concepts?

5️⃣ Resistance to pseudo-intelligence
Is the author avoiding empty jargon and performative intellectual display?
Are they using concepts to clarify and target reality, rather than to impress or obscure?

CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

MANDATORY STRUCTURE - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

1️⃣ PRIMARY ANALYSIS (THESIS):
Your best initial read of the text. Give your clearest, strongest cognitive profile of the text using your existing profiling instructions. Must identify:
- SPECIFIC evidence of cognitive operations being performed
- HOW the author demonstrates (or fails to demonstrate) genuine intellectual control
- CONCRETE examples that distinguish authentic reasoning from performative complexity
- PRECISE assessment of whether they're clarifying reality or performing sophistication

2️⃣ DISSENTING ANALYSIS (ANTITHESIS):
Generate a well-argued Dissenting Analysis that seriously challenges your Primary Analysis:
- NOT a straw man argument
- Must represent how a highly intelligent critic would attack your Primary Analysis
- Should challenge specific aspects with genuine evidence
- Must consider alternative interpretations of the same textual evidence
- Think: "How would an expert cognitive analyst completely disagree with my reading?"

3️⃣ SUPER-THESIS:
Generate a final assessment that responds to the Dissenting Analysis:
- Defend and refine your Primary Analysis against the critique
- Concede any valid points from the Dissent where appropriate  
- Sharpen your original read to produce a final, stronger profile
- Do NOT simply split the difference - produce a clarified, defensible, high-quality profile
- Must be a STRONGER, more defensible version that withstands intelligent critique

MANDATORY FORMAL DIAGNOSTIC COMPONENTS:
In addition to the Thesis/Antithesis/Super-Thesis structure, you MUST include these six formal diagnostic components:

1️⃣ TYPE OF INTELLIGENCE: Identify what type(s) of intelligence the speaker exhibits (abstract, practical, verbal, social, conceptual, analytic, synthetic, philosophical, emotional, manipulative, pseudo-intellectual, etc.). State this in formal terms.

2️⃣ COMPARISON TO PARADIGM EXAMPLES: How does this person's cognitive style compare to paradigm examples of this intelligence type? Are they weak/strong/mixed? What is distinctive about their style relative to typical strong examples?

3️⃣ UNIQUE STRENGTHS: List unique cognitive strengths evident in this text. Focus on real evidence of unusual competence, not generic praise.

4️⃣ UNIQUE WEAKNESSES: List unique cognitive weaknesses evident in this text. Specify what kind of weaknesses, in what way. Distinguish from typical weaknesses in their intelligence type.

5️⃣ LIKELY CAREER FIT / INTELLECTUAL ECOSYSTEM: What intellectual ecosystem or career would this speaker thrive in? Where would their cognitive style be rewarded vs. a liability?

6️⃣ MOST REVEALING QUOTATION: Select the single most diagnostically revealing quotation from the text. Explain why this quotation reveals the core of their cognitive strengths/weaknesses.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text.slice(0, 8000)}

MANDATORY SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Identify SPECIFIC reasoning stages in the argument structure
- Analyze HOW inferential control is maintained throughout each transition
- Describe PRECISELY how concepts are targeted and bounded
- Identify SPECIFIC evidence of epistemic risk awareness and management
- Your analysis must be so detailed it could only apply to THIS particular reasoning pattern

Rate on 1-10 scale with DETAILED JUSTIFICATION citing specific textual evidence:
- Analytical Depth: Provide specific evidence of reasoning quality vs. performed analysis
- Conceptual Integration: Cite specific examples of precision vs. superficial complexity  
- Logical Structuring: Identify specific evidence of epistemic discipline vs. posturing

  const prompt = `You are a psychological profiling agent. You do not perform sentiment analysis. You do not perform literal belief extraction. You do not assume that the author sincerely believes what they say.

You must always ask: "What kind of person would choose to say this, in this way, in this context?"
You must never assume that the content of an utterance reflects the author's sincere values or beliefs.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text.slice(0, 8000)}

For every utterance, follow this process:

1. SURFACE PARSING: Parse the literal meaning of the utterance.

2. PLAUSIBILITY MODELING: Ask: Is this a plausible sincere expression of an ordinary person's inner state?
   If NO → mark this utterance as performative/strategic/manipulative candidate.
   If YES → proceed to step 3.

3. SPEECH ACT MODELING: For each utterance, identify the most likely social function:
   - Sincere self-report
   - Virtue-signaling
   - Reputation management
   - Flattery/seduction
   - Threat/dominance display
   - Irony/satire
   - Defensive posturing
   - Identity signaling
   - Other manipulation

4. PROFILE INFERENCE: Only after identifying the speech function, infer personality traits.
   CRITICALLY: if the utterance is marked performative/manipulative, then your inference should focus on the speaker's manipulativeness, social strategy, or likely psychopathic traits — not on the literal content.

HEURISTICS TO APPLY:
- Too good to be true → probably not true
- Unusual moral heroism → probable signaling
- Extreme flattening of complex values → probable signaling or manipulation
- Statements designed to pre-empt social judgment → probable identity performance
- Implausible flattery → probable seduction or manipulation

You are not a belief extractor. You are a profiler of speaker psychology based on how and why they speak as they do.
You must model speech acts first, then profile.
You must explicitly distinguish between what the person says and what kind of person says it.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate THREE distinct analytical perspectives in dialectical sequence
2. Support each contention with specific quotes and arguments
3. Antithesis must present the most opposed view that aligns with the data
4. Super-Thesis must defend original position and refute antithesis
5. MANDATORY: You must explicitly generate and label all six sections of the Formal Diagnostic Extension in every Psychological Profile. Do not skip or merge them. They must be clearly visible to the user.
6. Be precise and discriminative - avoid generic terms
7. Target analysis for highly intelligent readers (top 1% intelligence)

FORMAL DIAGNOSTIC REQUIREMENTS - MUST BE EXPLICITLY LABELED:
1️⃣ Emotional Configuration / Style: Identify dominant emotional style (emotionally open, guarded, strategic, repressed, performative, intense, flat, manipulative, morally self-congratulatory, balanced, chaotic, etc.)
2️⃣ Comparison to Paradigm Examples: Compare to paradigm examples - weak/average/strong/unusual example
3️⃣ Unique Psychological Strengths: List precise, discriminative strengths (emotional resilience, empathic discipline, strategic self-regulation, moral clarity, etc.)
4️⃣ Unique Psychological Weaknesses: Specify how emotional/psychological style may distort reasoning, social engagement, or self-understanding
5️⃣ Interpersonal / Social Dynamics Fit: Where would this emotional/psychological style thrive vs be a liability
6️⃣ Most Revealing Quotation and Why: Single most diagnostically significant quote with analysis

MANDATORY: You MUST include the complete formalDiagnostics section with all six labeled components. This is NOT optional.

2️⃣ paradigmComparison - MUST compare to paradigm examples of this emotional type
3️⃣ uniquePsychologicalStrengths - MUST identify specific psychological strengths
4️⃣ uniquePsychologicalWeaknesses - MUST identify specific psychological weaknesses  
5️⃣ interpersonalSocialFit - MUST assess where this style thrives vs struggles
6️⃣ mostRevealingQuotation - MUST select actual quote and explain its significance
